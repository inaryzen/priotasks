# Feature Description Document - 11

## Overview
Add a task limit filter component to the filter panel that allows users to control the number of tasks displayed on the screen. This addresses the issue of too many tasks being discouraging to users by providing a way to limit the view to a manageable number of tasks.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Add a checkbox-enabled filter component to limit the number of tasks returned from server
- Default limit should be 10 tasks when filter is enabled
- Filter should be enabled by default (show limited number of tasks)
- Input field should allow users to customize the task limit
- Filter should integrate with existing filtering mechanisms
- Filter value must be persisted as for other filters
- Server-side implementation should respect the task limit parameter
- UI should provide clear visual indication of filter state

## User Stories
```
As a user with many tasks
I want to limit the number of tasks displayed
So that I can focus on a manageable subset without feeling overwhelmed
```

```
As a user
I want to control the task limit number
So that I can adjust the view to my preference
```

## Technical Specifications
### Architecture
- Modify filter panel component to include task limit filter
- Update task handlers to accept and process limit parameter
- Modify task service to implement task limiting logic
- Update database queries to support LIMIT clause

### Data Model
- No new database entities required
- Existing task queries will be modified to support LIMIT parameter

### API Endpoints
- Modify existing task listing endpoints to accept `limit` query parameter
- Update HTMX requests to include limit parameter when filter is enabled

### Dependencies
- HTMX for dynamic form submission
- Templ for component rendering
- Existing filter panel infrastructure

## Implementation Plan
- [ ] Investigate Current UI: Examine existing filter panel and task loading mechanism
- [ ] Update TasksQuery Model: Add fields for task limit filtering (EnableLimit, LimitCount)
- [ ] Add Filter Constants: Define constants for the new filter components
- [ ] Update Filter Panel Template: Add checkbox and input field for task limit
- [ ] Modify Task Handlers: Update handlers to accept and process limit parameter
- [ ] Implement Filter Persistence Logic: Update database settings persistence for limit filter
- [ ] Update Task Service: Implement task limiting logic in service layer
- [ ] Modify Database Queries: Add LIMIT support to task retrieval queries
- [ ] Update HTMX Integration: Ensure filter changes trigger proper server requests
- [ ] Test UI Implementation: Validate the feature works correctly using chrome-devtools-mcp
